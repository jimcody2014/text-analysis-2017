# Computational Text Analysis for Humanists and Social Scientists
### A Digital Humanities Workshop for Claremont Colleges
### 22-24 May 2017, 10AM - 4PM
### Instructors: Hovig Tchalian and Laura Nelson

# Overview

Increasingly, humanity’s cultural material is being captured and stored in the form of electronic
text. From historical documents, literature and poems, diaries, political speeches, and government
documents, to emails, text messages, and social media, students from the humanities and social
sciences now have access to immense amounts of rich, and diverse, text. Scholars are
increasingly using computational methods to analyze these new sources of text in order to ask,
and answer, a diverse array of questions about the social world: Does social media reflect public
political opinion, or drive it? What determines trust in online communities? What types of blog
posts get censored in China and why? Are diurnal and seasonal mood cycles cross-cultural? What
was the form of cultural and institutional change through the “civilizing process” in England
between the 16th and 20th centuries? What is the life cycle of a literary genre? What are textual
allusions in Classical Latin poetry? Can the FBI really analyze 650,000 emails in 3 days?
(Spoiler: Yes, they can!)

In this workshop you will learn cutting-edge methods to analyze large amounts of texts to explore
questions fundamental to the humanities and social sciences. We will not have computers read the
text for us. Instead, we will harness the superior ability for computers to count and extract
patterns from text, and use this output to enhance our own critical thinking and interpretive
analyses.

# Requirements

This workshop will be taught in the open source programming language Python using the Jupyter environment. While no prior programming experience is required or assumed, your time in this workshop will be much more productive if you come in with some basic knowledge of Python. Participants are strongly encouraged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) to learn the basic syntax of the Python programming language.
